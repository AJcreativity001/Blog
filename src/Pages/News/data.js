    content: "The Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams has urged the United Nations (UN) and other international organisations to immediately intervene in the rising insecurity in Nigeria. He said “no part of Nigeria is safe again.” Adams disclosed this in a letter addressed to the UN Secretary-General, Mr António Guterres, and copies sent to the European Union (EU), African Union (AU), United States State Departments, Council on Foreign Relations, the International Association for Religious Freedom in the United Kingdom, and other international organisations. In the letter entitled, “Avoiding a replica of the Bosnian War in Nigeria,” the traditional ruler warned that the present insecurity, if not tamed, could consume Nigeria. DAILY POST recently reported that at least 40 people, including children and women, were killed by yet-to-be-identified gunmen at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State, earlier this month. Also, about 80 others picked varying degrees of injuries during the fatal attack.The letter partly read, “Pitiably, terrorists moving from northern Nigeria to the South are being embraced, encouraged and empowered by powers that be in Nigeria. “I am raising this alarm now because the effect of this dangerous trend may ultimately balkanise Nigeria and affect sub-Saharan Africa. “Similar alarm was raised in defunct Yugoslavia and sadly, nobody put in check the pogromists whose actions led to the massacre in that geographical location."

        title: "You are only fair to Northern Nigeria – Abaribe tells Buhari",

        content: "The former Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, has slammed President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government over alleged regionalism. Abaribe accused Buhari-led government of being fair only to the Northern part of the country. Featuring on Arise TV, the lawmaker said the current administration had downplayed non-northern region. He said, “The APC government-led by President Muhammadu Buhari was not fair. He was totally unfair to the people, who are not from what he claims is his own place. “At the time I was saying that, I was talking for the rest of Nigeria and I will continue to advocate for Nigeria.” Abaribe also explained why he ignored the All Progressives Congress, APC, after he dumped the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The lawmaker said he chose the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA due to his ideology. He said: “If I was non-ideological, I would go to APC. “If you have the major ideology, it will now be the conservative APC and the progressives non-APC. “I’m still in the non-APC, so I’m ideologically-inclined that I will not be part of the hegemony.”"

        title: "Fuel scarcity: Arewa youths ask Buhari to sack Sylva, Kyari, Farouk",
        date: "Published on June 20, 2022",
        publisher: "By Amos Tauna",
        image:  Image3,
        content: "Following the continued fuel scarcity in parts of the country for some months without end, the Amalgamation of Arewa Youths Groups (AAYG) has called for the sacking of Chief Timipre Sylva, the Minister of State for Petroleum; Mr Mele Kyari, the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited; and Mr Farouk Ahmed, the Managing Director of Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority. The forum described them as saboteurs who have betrayed the trust of President Muhammadu Buhari and quest to leave a legacy of easy access to petroleum products without queues. A statement issued by Comrade Abubakar Musa Ardo and Comrade Victor Duniya, Secretary and Spokesman of the group respectively, noted that during the previous scarcity in the early part of this year, both the NNPC and Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) accused some major importers of importing high Methanolic contaminated Premium Motor Spirit, with the promise of bringing the said companies to justice. The statement lamented that till date, nobody has been punished for inflicting pain on Nigerians. The statement regretted, “While Mr Farouk and his boys are sleeping or in active, independent petroleum marketers are selling PMS in most Northern states as high as N250.This is against the National benchmark and highly subsidized rate of N165.” It called on Mr. President to wield the big stick on the trior of Sylva, Kyari and Ahmed for a clear act of sabotage and an attempt to pitch Nigerians against him.The youths also called on the National Assembly to urgently probe the subsidy regime and compare notes with previous years to dictate the rigged figure by both the NNPC and NMDPRA, saying that it is meant to ensure that all those concerns are punished. The statement enjoined antigraft agencies to probe the activities of the staff of NMDPRA for possible collusion with Independent Petroleum Marketers to financially rape the federal government and Nigerians, as PMS now sells far above the national benchmark. The statement observed, “We recognize that both Mele Kyari and Mr Farouk Ahmed are all from our region, there is no gainsaying that they have failed woefully in their responsibilities, we strongly support change in guards in their offices as they appeared to have run out of ideas on how to end the lingering energy crisis in the country.” The youths stated that if their demands are not met in the next five working days, they will organize their members from towns and villages to occupy all NNPC zonal offices and its subsidiaries across the region and the FCT until they see changes. The youths said that their demand is not just a mere threat, saying that they would follow up with full action after the expiration of the ultimatum and will serve as a litmus test on the part of the government in their fight against corruption and indiscipline. The youths noted that one of the consequences of inadequate supply of the petroleum products in the region is the renewed killings by terrorists as security agencies are equally struggling to access the product in most rural communities that are soft targets for criminal elements, regretting that security personnel are largely immobilized to respond to distress calls."
